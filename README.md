### Key Concepts
#### JSX
JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that allows you to write HTML directly within React. It makes it easier to create and visualize your UI components.
#### Props
Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from parent components to child components. They allow you to pass data and event handlers down the component tree.
#### State
State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. When the state object changes, the component re-renders.
#### Hooks
Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. The most common hooks are useState and useEffect.
#### Components
Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be functional or class-based and help you organize your UI into reusable pieces.
#### Responsive Design
Responsive design ensures that your application looks great on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. We'll use TailwindCSS to achieve this.
#### Styling with TailwindCSS
TailwindCSS is a utility-first CSS framework that allows you to style your application quickly and efficiently. It provides a set of predefined classes that you can apply to your HTML elements.
